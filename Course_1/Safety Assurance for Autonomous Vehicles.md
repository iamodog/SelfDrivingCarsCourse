# Safety Assurance for Self-Driving Vehicles

First, we see some of the autonomous driving accidents.

Safety terms:

- Harm : Refer to the physical harm to a living thing.
- Risk : Probability that a event occurs + severity of the harm of the event

Major Hazard Sources:

- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Hardware
- Software
- Sensors
- Incorrect planning or decision making
- Fallback of the human
- Cyber-attack

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration or NHTSA, has defined a twelve-part safety framework to structure safety assessment for autonomous driving.

# Industry Methods for Safety Assurance and Testing

According to industry methods, in California, currently , Waymo had driven 563 000km with 63 disengagements, it's 1 disengagement every 9000km. GM (General Motor) had driven 210 000km with 105 disengagement, it's 1 disengagement every 2000km.

The question is to know: How many miles (in year) would autonomous vehicles have to be driven to demonstrate with 95% confidence their failure rate to within 20% of the true rate of 1 fatality per 146 millions km (= Human capabilities)

The answer is : " It would take at least 400 years to do so with a fleet of 100 vehicles traveling 24/7"

# Safety Frameworks for Self-Driving

There exists simple analytic framework:
- Fault trees and probabilistic fault trees
- Failure modes and effect analysis

And functional safety framework:
- FuSa HARA : Safety requirements trough risk analysis
- SOTIF : Behavior risk assessment
